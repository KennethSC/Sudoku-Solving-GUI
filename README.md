## Description

This project is meant to solve any solvable sudoku by implementing the Backtracking Algorithm. It also includes a Graphical user interface (GUI) that visualizes how the backtracking algorithm actually works on a real sudoku board so that the user can get a better understanding of how the algorithm actually works.


## Requirements

The only requirement for this project is pygame for the GUI.
To install pygame all you have to do is run the following command in your terminal (Mac): pip install pygame
