## Description

The file SudokuSolver.py is meant to solve any solvable sudoku by implementing the Backtracking Algorithm and ouputting the formatted solution to the command line. The main project is a graphical user interface (GUI) that visualizes how the backtracking algorithm can solve a real sudoku board so that the user can get a better understanding of how the algorithm actually works.


## Requirements

__Pygame:__
 
To install pygame on Mac use this command in your terminal: pip install pygame

## Instructions
To use the GUI all you have to do is run Solver_GUI.py on any python interpreter (I used VSCode), and to make sure that all the files above are in the same directory when running. To visualize the algorithm click on the 'SOLVE' button  and just watch the algorithm work. To try the algorithm on a new sudoku board click on buttons 'Board1' - 'Board9' with Board1 being the easiest sudoku and Board9 being the hardest.
