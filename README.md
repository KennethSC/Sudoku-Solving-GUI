## Description

The file SudokuSolver.py is meant to solve any solvable sudoku by implementing the Backtracking Algorithm and ouputting the formatted solution to the command line. The main project is a Graphical user interface (GUI) that visualizes how the backtracking algorithm actually works on a real sudoku board so that the user can get a better understanding of how the algorithm actually works.


## Requirements

The only requirement for this project is pygame for the GUI.
To install pygame all you have to do is run the following command (assuming you already have pip installed) in your terminal (Mac): pip install pygame
If you do not have pip installed then you can follow this link that walks you through on how to install it on MacOS or OSX: https://ahmadawais.com/install-pip-macos-os-x-python/
