## Description

The file SudokuSolver.py is meant to solve any solvable sudoku by implementing the Backtracking Algorithm and ouputting the formatted solution to the command line. The main project is a Graphical user interface (GUI) that visualizes how the backtracking algorithm actually works on a real sudoku board so that the user can get a better understanding of how the algorithm actually works.


## Requirements

The only requirement for this project is pygame for the GUI.
To install pygame all you have to do is run the following command (assuming you already have pip installed) in your terminal (Mac): pip install pygame

If you don't have pip installed then you can follow this link that walks you through on installing it on MacOS or OSX: https://ahmadawais.com/install-pip-macos-os-x-python/ 


## Instructions
To use the GUI all you have to do is run Solver_GUI.py on any python interpreter (I used VSCode), and to make sure that all the files above are in the same directory when running. To visualize the algorithm press the spacebar on your keyboard and just watch the algorithm work. To try the algorithm on a new sudoku board just press any number key from (1-9) with 1 being the easiest sudoku and 9 being the hardest.
